# Cinema Chain Management System
The project is a cinema chain management system that uses an Oracle database to store information about movies, cinemas, halls, tickets, customers, and employees. It includes an associative table - PROJECTION - between the HALL and FILM tables. The system allows for quick and easy access to data through a search engine based on different conditions.
